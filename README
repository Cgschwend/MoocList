Mooclist is a Spring-Boot application that displays local tech jobs and offers two features not currently found on other job listing sites:

1.  A feature to show local technology Meetup groups using  Meetup's API.

2.  A feature to see recommended MOOC that relate to a particular job listing.

Mooclist has been redesigned into two independent applications, MoocClient and MoocService.
